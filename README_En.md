# Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

## About this portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Science and Analytics Portfolio**, a collection of projects that showcase my skills in **data analysis**, **machine learning**, **data modeling**, and **data visualization for decision-making**.

Each project covers different stages of the analytical process — from **data collection and cleaning**, through **exploratory analysis**, **predictive model training**, and **interactive dashboard creation**.

> This portfolio is continuously evolving, with new projects being added as I advance in my learning and professional development in the data field.
